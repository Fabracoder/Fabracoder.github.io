X-Axis Symmetry
     Regular Polygons

Circles


Layers?

---------------------


Given any point of interest you can create X-Axis Symmetry
    0 = invisable
    1 = Circle
    2 = (line) Mirror
    3 = Triangle
    4 = Square
Any Path can be replaced with a symbol chain
Any Path can be replaced with a symbol chain next to it ( on either or both sides )
Any Path can be replaced with a symbol chain (between two new paths)
 
Point 
    [Properties: LocDef]
    (center point of screen is provided if there is none, all other points come form path intersections)

Line
    [Properties: LocDef[],Distance, Rotation, Side# % PolySize]
    (Line Segment in reality. You can speficy visability for any line segment displayed from regular polygon)
    (Distance refers to the length of the line, it is attached at the centerpoint to LocDef if LocDef only has 1 point)

Any point can generate a X-Axis Symmetry layer
   
    Anything can be placed with a given distance and angle provided
    (if no angle is provided then it defaults to 0, simularly 0 for distance)


X-Axis Symmetry layer
    Distance
    Symmetry #
    Opacity Within layer (border lines are )
    Layer Precidence #

Rotation:
    degrees Relative (to parent)
    degrees Relative (to other point)
    degrees Absolute 
    Point At (other Point, degrees)
    

Issue
    Interweaved (think celtic knots)
        Resolution?
                each intersection point can have an override on layer precidence


Future Features
3D! 
ND!
Color
    Any path segment can have it's own color modifier.
        Absolute
        Relative

Import image   
Symbol // preferably vector image but other images can be imported as well
    [Properties: Size(LocDef,Imported File Image Location,bounding area]

Curve
    Defined by equation

Animation
